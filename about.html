		</div>

		<main class="info">
			<div class="item">
				<h3>Plastic cell phone cases</h3>
				<p>Plastics are one of the most used, inexpensive and durable materials for cell phone cases. A plastic cell phone case adds style and personality to the phone while protecting it from scratches, bumps, cracks, chips and breakages from minor falls.</p>

				<p>There are numerous types of plastic materials for mobile phone cases, with the most popular being the polyurethane and the polycarbonate.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h3>Polyurethane Cell Phone Cases</h3>
				<p>The polyurethane is an inexpensive cell phone case material often available in either soft or hard form. The plastic material is readily molded into a desired shape and is easy to recycle. Due to the ease of molding, the cell phone case made from the plastic can have many customized designs and patterns.</p>


			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h3>Polycarbonate Cell Phone Cases</h3>
				<p>Polycarbonate is a tough, durable, and lightweight plastic material which provides maximum protection against drops. Due to its strength, the material is suitable for a variety of strong products such as: bullet proof glass, storage containers and eyeglasses.</p>
				<p>Optional coatings or additives are usually added on the material to protect it from degradation by UV rays as well scratches. Polycarbonate cases are suitable for protecting cell phones against heavy drops up to 20 feet.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h3>Carbon Fibre Cell Phone Cases</h3>
				<p>The carbon fiber material is made by weaving together strands of carbon to produce a very light material that is even stronger than steel.  Carbon fibre cell phone cases are some of the most expensive, however the cost is justified by the material’s sophisticated woven look, lightweight, and strength.</p>
				<p>The carbon fiber is very thin but capable of providing excellent protection against scratches and other common damages. The mobile phone cases from carbon fibre are ideal for securing the cell phone from medium-drops on concrete and other hard surfaces.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h3>Wood Cell Phone Cases</h3>
				<p>The wooden cell phone material is easy to customize and engrave or etch to create custom and unique designs. Preferred wood is from the sustainable bamboo trees which are usually seen as green; others include the redwood, cherry etc.</p>
				<p>The customized wooden enclosed phones can be very unique and look like a piece of great art. However, the cell phone cases from wood are not widely available in phone accessories stores but can be sourced from a variety of manufacturers online.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h3>Leather Cell Phone Cases</h3>
				<p>Leather and synthetic leather materials are classic choices for cell phone cases that convey style and elegance but not much protection. The cases will, at most, protect against chipping, scratches and other light daily wear but not against drops.</p>
				<p>The natural leather comes from animal hides while synthetic is made from plastics such as polyester and polyurethane. The two types have a soft feel; however, the natural leather is more durable and superior in quality.</p>  
			</div>	
			<div class="item">
				<h3>Metal Cell Phone Cases</h3>
				<p>Metal has been used for some of the high end mobile devices and has a great reputation, feels smooth, cool and expensive. Unfortunately, it tends to be heavier that the other materials. Another concern is that it reflects radio waves, something which can weaken the phone’s signal.</p>


				<p>Metal cases offer the best protection. The hard exterior of the metal cases withstands impacts and won’t break, crack or chip.Common metals include: aluminum, brass, titanium, and alloy of precious metals such as gold, etc.</p>  
				<p>The metal case is the hardest and able to withstand the largest of impacts as well as protecting the phone against minor or intense scratches.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="item">
				<h3>Silicone Cell Phone Cases</h3>
				<p>The Silicon material is a gel-like soft substance made from silicon and petroleum products. The Silicon cell phone cases are flexible and able to stretch over the cell phone thereby maintaining the phone’s shape and style, the gel-like surface texture in thick silicon cases are capable of absorbing the shocks and create protection of the cell phone during low-impact drops. As a result, the silicon is ideal in withstanding everyday low impact stresses.</p>
